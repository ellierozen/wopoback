While I worked on this project in a group, I created all of the backend and almost all of the frontend besides some design factors. I used open AI key to create my water polo chatbot, and used chat gpt in help creating this api. I also used a database provided by my teacher to help create my player statistics data base, but it wasn't the same exact one.
